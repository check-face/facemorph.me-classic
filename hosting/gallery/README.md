# Synthetic asset collection

This static-only Workers deployment uses no paid object storage or inference. The staged `public/` directory is deliberately ignored; reconstruct it from the verified selection, never from the full Triton directory.

Published 16 September 2026 at https://facemorph-seed-gallery.cdilga.workers.dev, version `93f60a7a-d703-4fd9-9132-209d45cddee1`:

- 5,055 public-name previews at 200px.
- 2,911 available historic full-size name images.
- Numeric seeds0–999 at1024px.
- 8,966 images /364,039,372bytes; all historic lossy originals.

Every public-name identity was recomputed from its exact lowercase request with SHA-256; every numeric identity and source shard was derived from its seed. Every copied file was checked against its measured size and SHA-256 before publication. No recovered-photo/GUID identities are permitted.

The workspace's `review-artifacts/static-assets-2026-09-16/verified-selection.json` is the complete file ledger. `cloudflare-publication.json` records three public byte/hash checks. New1024 PNG canonical originals belong in the device cache and are not substituted by these historic images.

Deploy with `wrangler deploy --config hosting/gallery/wrangler.jsonc` only after reconstructing and validating the explicit allowlist. Keep this origin static-only; no worker code or upload endpoint is required.

## Public-name supplement, 10 October 2026

[run 38029582696](https://github.com/facemorph-me/facemorph.me-classic/actions/runs/38029582696).
All 5,055 public names have pinned W+ assets; the 2,144 missing full-size previews
are now published. Existing historic full-size previews retain their origin.
The published catalogue matches the CI artifact and its SHA-256 ledger exactly;
see the [publication receipt](../../docs/review/candidate-2026-10-10/name-publication.json).

NumPy independently verified all input Z identities; pinned CPU mapping generated
the W+ assets. On-device synthesis produces canonical PNGs from verified W+,
while hosted JPEGs remain display previews. Identity/hash verification is not a
claim of numerical parity across every device. The delivery CPU gate exercises
a published name without accepting silent mapping fallback.
